## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The **Dynamic Lexical Analyzer** is a mini project that demonstrates how a **Lexical Analyzer** (an essential part of a compiler) works.  
It helps visualize the **conversion of Regular Expression â†’ NFA â†’ DFA â†’ Tokens** in an easy and interactive way.  
This project takes input code and breaks it down into **tokens** such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operators â€” all in **real-time** using simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To provide a **clear and visual understanding** of how lexical analysis processes input text into valid tokens using **Automata Theory concepts**.  
Itâ€™s a bridge between **theoretical knowledge** and **practical understanding** for students learning compiler design.
