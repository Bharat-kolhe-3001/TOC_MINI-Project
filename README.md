# 🧩 Dynamic Lexical Analyzer - Real-time Tokenization  

![Project Banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/your-username/dynamic-lexical-analyzer-banner.png)  

This mini project **Dynamic Lexical Analyzer** is developed by *Bharat Kolhe* as part of the **Theory of Computation (TOC)** subject. It demonstrates the process of **Lexical Analysis (RE → NFA → DFA)** in real time using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project allows users to type any code and see instant **tokenization results**, identifying **identifiers, keywords, numbers, operators, and errors** dynamically with a visually interactive interface. It also provides **live statistics** such as character count, token count, and errors, along with a **pipeline visualization** showing how the lexical analysis process works. To use it, simply **download or clone the repository**, open `index.html` in your browser, and start typing your code — tokens will appear instantly in the output panel. Example input like `if x >= 10 else y = 20` generates tokens such as **KEYWORD (if)**, **IDENTIFIER (x)**, and **OPERATOR (>=)**. Below is a preview of the running project:
