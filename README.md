## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Dynamic Lexical Analyzer** is a mini project that demonstrates how a **Lexical Analyzer** (an essential part of a compiler) works.  
It helps visualize the **conversion of Regular Expression → NFA → DFA → Tokens** in an easy and interactive way.  
This project takes input code and breaks it down into **tokens** such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, and operators — all in **real-time** using simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To provide a **clear and visual understanding** of how lexical analysis processes input text into valid tokens using **Automata Theory concepts**.  
It’s a bridge between **theoretical knowledge** and **practical understanding** for students learning compiler design.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time token generation  
✅ Highlights keywords, identifiers, and numbers  
✅ Detects invalid or unknown symbols  
✅ Displays live statistics (line, token, and character count)  
✅ Color-coded output for better visualization  
✅ Simple user-friendly interface built with web technologies

## 🧮 Example for  Demonstration

**Input:**
```text
if x >= 10 else y = 20
